This document is intended to record everywhere that the emulator varies from the original, or where I had to guesstimate behaviour.

1. Charactron cost: I have no information regarding the monthly cost of a Charactron. The purchase price however was $325,000 (and presumably integration). To calculate the monthly cost, I've taken the High-speed printer and calculated the purchase/monthly price ratio. Then divided the purchase price of the Charactron by the ratio. This comes out to $5,797 including maintenance per month. If we compare this to an IBM 740 (a competitor) at $2,850 a month including maintenance this estimate might be reasonable. The 740 is significantly cheaper, but is far simpler and less capable than the Charactron.
2. Required area, weight and personnel for an installation vary greatly between installations, numbers selected and an average and should be used as a close-enough guide.
