# History

* The first machine whose design was led by Cray, clearly influenced by the ERA drum machines that came before.
* The repeat instruction didn't exist on the 1101. And so might have been invented by Cray. The Pilot ACE also had a far more limited, difficult, repeat that might have served as inspiration.
* There is a strong influence in terminology and concepts between the 1101 and 1103, yet these are fairly different machines, random access vs drum, single address vs two address for example. There's also influence on Cray's future machines evident here.
* For an early machine, the 1103 is remarkably elegant, there's a beauty in it. Compare it's instruction set to whatever the 704 was doing. The 704's only real advantage was address registers. Or even worse, compare to a English Electric DEUCE.
* Despite Cray's focus on simplicity, there was clearly still some learning to do. The IO devices make no sense the for types of problems the machine was designed for. Apparently "a little bit of everything" was the order of the day. It's hard to imagine how useful paper tape IO was or the weird address display thing. IBM probably had a bit of an advantage in design elegance here. Three years later, by the time of the CDC 1604, Cray had become serious about IO performance.
* In a head to head comparison the IBM 701 was unanimously favoured by a Joint Chiefs of Staff weather prediction project, because of its better IO equipment. A lesson Cray might have taken to heart.
* Possibly the first machine to use modern interrupts.
* Second to market with floating point instructions (after 704).

## Known Installations

* White Sands Missile Range
* Eglin Air Force Base, Florida
* Air Force Missile Development Center (Holloman Air Force Base)
* Wright Air Development Division
* Lockheed Missile and Space Division (2 machines)
* Johns Hopkins University (2 machines)
* Southern Methodist
* University of Minnesota (Transferred from Ramo-Wooldridge?)
* Ramo-Wooldridge (second of their two)
* NACA (forerunner to NASA)
* Convair
* Boeing (from USE meeting notes)
* Remington-Rand
* Two ATLAS II's were delivered to the NSA, the History of NSA General Purpose Electronic Digital Computers calls "almost identical to" the 1103, except without magnetic tape.

Some the above aren't listed in the BRL report, probably because the machines had been retired by 1961 when the survey was conducted.

The types of organisations which purchased the machine make clear the main application of the machine was aircraft and missile design, especially data ingestion, reduction and analysis.

The BRL report shows most users moving to IBM 7090s and two to CDC 1604s.

Many of installations had some form of analog-digital converter added.
